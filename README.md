# Moth
 A Game about lasers and stuff.

Take lasers and refract them through lenses using snells law. Change color of the laser by shining it through filters. Use prisims to split light into all of its different colors. Point laser at the gems of similar color to charge them and beat levels. Moths spawn and are attracted to charged gems. Oh yeah also im using 2D lights and shadows from Unitys Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

Taught myself object pooling, that was cool!

Made in Unity Engine.
